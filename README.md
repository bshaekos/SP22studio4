# Omni - A Cyborg Technology

Project Brief: 

Design a technological something (e.g., wearable, device, tool, space,
software, infrastructure) that gives YOU, or one of your peers, a special ability
or superpower. The final deliverable is a prototype or prop, brought to life
through demo, performance, enactment, and/or visual narrative.
